# VMware Tanzu Community Edition High-Level Program Roadmap

## About this Document

This document provides an overview of the major themes driving Tanzu Community Edition program development, as well as constituent features and capabilities. Roadmap items are tracked by their implementation stage within the enhancements proposal process: Awaiting Proposal, Proposal in Review, and Implementation in Progress. The stages are documented below. Most items are gathered from the community or include a feedback loop with the community.

The scope of this roadmap is the entire Tanzu Community Edition program, which includes this GitHub project repository, the [Tanzu Framework](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/tanzu-framework) project repository, the project repositories for packages delivered as part of Tanzu Commmunity Edition, and non-code program aspects such as videos, training materials, and community activities.

This roadmap should serve as a reference point for Tanzu Community Edition users to help us prioritize existing features, provide input on unmet needs, and for contributors to understand where the project is heading. Contributors can also consult the roadmap when thinking of proposing new ideas and determine if their idea conflicts with the roadmap. If it does conflict, the team and community will need to determine whether to adjust the roadmap or to recommend changes to the idea.

Enhancement stages help everyone understand if something is in the early stages of an idea or if it has wider community buy-in and committed resources. This is important because it helps limit waste, and focus work on the most important and timely activities. The stages are described below:

* Awaiting Proposal - these enhancements are in the idea mode, and the project maintainers are awaiting a detailed proposal. This state is useful to explore different solutions to a known problem and encourage discussion.
* Proposal in Review - maintainers are currently reviewing the proposal, which includes resource requirements and commitments.
* Implementation in Progress - engineering work has begun and will be tracking towards a release target.

## How to help

If you'd like to contribute but don't have anything to propose, check out our [issues](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/issues) for issues tagged
[help-wanted](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted) or
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/labels/good-first-issue).

You can participate in discussion on the roadmap in threads under Issues and in scheduled roadmap sessions in community meetings. Questions may also be brought up in our Google Group or our Slack channel. Community members are encouraged to be actively involved, and also stay informed so contributions can be made with the most positive effect and limited duplication of effort.

## How to add an item to the roadmap

Please create an issue using the Feature Request template to propose a feature for the project. We will work with and rely on our community to help us flesh out and prioritize our efforts to improve Tanzu Community Edition. Or feel free to submit a pull request against your issue for assessment by the team and community.

## Current High-Level Roadmap

The following table includes the current roadmap for Tanzu Community Edition. Please take timelines and dates as proposals and goals. Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback, roadblocks encountered, community contributions, etc. If you depend on a specific item, we encourage you to attend community meetings to get updated status information, or help us deliver that feature by contributing.

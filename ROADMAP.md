# VMware Tanzu Community Edition High-level Roadmap

### About this Document

This document provides an overview of the major themes drivingTanzu Community Edition development, as well as some of the features and
capabilities that will manifest those priorities, grouped into 0-3 month, 3-6 month, and future buckets. Most items are gathered from
the community or include a feedback loop with the community. This should serve as a reference point for Tanzu Community Edition users
to help us prioritize and to supply input on unmet needs, and contributors to understand where the project is heading, and help
contributors to determine if a contribution could be conflicting with a longer term plan.

More detail about short-term delivery plans can be found in the [milestones](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/milestones) in
the [GitHub project repo](https://gitbub.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition).

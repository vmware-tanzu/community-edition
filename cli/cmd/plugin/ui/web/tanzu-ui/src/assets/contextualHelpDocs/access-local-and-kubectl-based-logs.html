    Tanzu Community Edition comes with a diagnostics CLI plugin that helps with the task of collecting diagnostics data when debugging
    installation issues. The plugin (based on the Crash-Diagnostics project) can automatically collect diagnostics data from either the
    bootstrap, management, unmanaged, or a workload cluster (or all four) using the tanzu diagnostics collect command. Learn more about

    When debugging a failed management cluster deployment, the kind bootstrap cluster is the key to being able to introspect and understand
    what is happening. Any issues or errors that occur in the kind bootstrap cluster during bootstrapping will provide information about
    potential problems in the final management cluster on the target provider. If the bootstrap process is stuck or did not finish
    successfully, use the diagnostics plugin to collect logs and cluster information.

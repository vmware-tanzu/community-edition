topicTitle: Cleanup after an unsuccessful management deployment
topicIds: [ctx-management-clusters]
-->

<p>
    When a management cluster fails to deploy successfully (or partially deploys), it may leave orphaned objects in your bootstrap
    environment.
</p>

<p>Clean the bootstrap environment prior to a subsequent attempt of redeploying the management cluster.</p>

<p>If the management cluster got partially created, attempt to delete the resources for the failed cluster:</p>

<p><code>tanzu management-cluster delete &lt;YOUR-CLUSTER-NAME&gt; </code></p>

<p>Next, if the bootstrap cluster still exists, delete it:</p>

<p>
    <code> kind get clusters tkg-kind-b4o9sn5948199qbgca8d</code>
</p>

<code> kind delete cluster --name tkg-kind-b4o9sn5948199qbgca8d</code>

<p>Use docker to stop and remove any running containers related to the bootstrap process</p>

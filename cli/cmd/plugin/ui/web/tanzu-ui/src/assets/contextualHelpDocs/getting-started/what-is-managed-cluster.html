<p>
    Managed clusters is a deployment model that features 1 management cluster and N workload cluster(s). The management cluster provides
    management and operations for Tanzu. It runs Cluster-API which is used to manage workload clusters and multi-cluster services. The
    workload cluster(s) are where developerâ€™s workloads run.
</p>
<p>
    When you create a management cluster, a bootstrap cluster is created on your local machine. This is a Kind based cluster, which runs via
    Docker. The bootstrap cluster creates a management cluster on your specified provider. The information for how to manage clusters in the
    target environment is then pivoted into the management cluster. At this point, the local bootstrap cluster is deleted.
</p>

<p>
    The management cluster can now create workload clusters. The workload cluster is deployed by the management cluster. The workload
    cluster is used to run your application workloads. The workload cluster is deployed using the Tanzu CLI.

<h4>Canâ€™t Upgrade Kubernetes</h4>
<p>
    By design, unmanaged clusters do not lifecycle-manage Kubernetes. They are not meant to be long-running with real workloads. To change
    Kubernetes versions, delete the existing cluster and create a new cluster with a different configuration.
</p>
<h4>Deploy to Windows</h4>
<p>
    <code>kind</code>, the default provider, has several known limitations when deploying to Windows. For example,
    <u>deploying a load balancer has networking considerations.</u> Be sure to familiarize yourself with the <code>kind</code>
    <u>documentation</u> in order to <u>customize your unmanaged-cluster deployment</u> for your needs.

<p>
    After you deploy a management cluster, you can scale it up or down by increasing or reducing the number of node VMs that it contains. To
    scale a management cluster, use the tanzu cluster scale command with one or both of the following options:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>--controlplane-machine-count</code> changes the number of management cluster control plane nodes.</li>

    <li><code>--worker-machine-count</code> changes the number of management cluster worker nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Because management clusters run in the tkg-system namespace rather than the default namespace, you must also specify the --namespace
    option when you scale a management cluster.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Run tanzu login before you run tanzu cluster scale to check that the management cluster you wish to scale is the current context of
        the Tanzu CLI.
    </li>

    <li>
        To scale a production management cluster that you originally deployed with 3 control plane nodes and 5 worker nodes to 5 and 10
        nodes respectively, run the following command:
        <code>
            tanzu cluster scale &lt;MANAGEMENT-CLUSTER-NAME&gt; --controlplane-machine-count 5 --worker-machine-count 10 --namespace
            tkg-system
        </code>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    If you initially deployed a development management cluster with one control plane node and you scale it up to 3 control plane nodes,
    Tanzu Community Edition automatically enables stacked HA on the control plane.
</p>

<p><b> IMPORTANT: </b> Do not change context or edit the .kube-tkg/config file while Tanzu Community Edition operations are running.</p>

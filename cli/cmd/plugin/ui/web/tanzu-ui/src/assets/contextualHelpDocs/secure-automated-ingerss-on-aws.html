<p>
    Now that you have provisioned workload clusters, it’s time to use it. If you want to deploy applications on this cluster you will need
    some packages installed on it that will give you some capabilities to improve the usage experience of the cluster.
</p>

<p>Install and properly configure the following Kubernetes services:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Ingress controller.</b> This is the entry point to your cluster. Requests will most likely be routed to applications running in
        Kubernetes via an Ingress Controller.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Certificate management.</b>
        Because your services should be exposed using a secure transport (HTTPS), you need to generate TLS certificates that your ingress
        controller will use to secure your application’s communication with the public.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>DNS management.</b>You want your applications to listen on a specific domain name, but you don’t know (or want) to learn how to
        configure Route53 or your DNS provider. With automatic DNS management integration, your services will directly be exposed where you
        expect them.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>With these services deployed, it becomes easier to deploy an application on a cluster and access it through a named URL.</p>

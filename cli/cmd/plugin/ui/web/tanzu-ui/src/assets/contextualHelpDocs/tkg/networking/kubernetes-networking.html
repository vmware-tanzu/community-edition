    In the Kubernetes Network section, configure the networking for Kubernetes services and click Next.<br />

    (vSphere only) Under Network Name, select a vSphere network to use as the Kubernetes service network. Review the Cluster Service CIDR
    and Cluster Pod CIDR ranges. If the recommended CIDR ranges of 100.64.0.0/13 and 100.96.0.0/11 are unavailable, update the values under
    Cluster Service CIDR and Cluster Pod CIDR.

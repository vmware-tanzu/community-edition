<p>
    Managed clusters are deployed and managed by a Tanzu management cluster. This is the primary deployment model for clusters in the Tanzu
    ecosystem and is recommended for production scenarios. To bootstrap managed clusters, you first need a management cluster. When creating
    a management cluster, a bootstrap cluster is created locally and is used to then create the management cluster.

<p>
    Once the management cluster has been created, the bootstrap cluster will perform a move (aka pivot) of all management objects to the
    management cluster. From this point forward, the management cluster is responsible for managing itself and any new clusters you create.
    These new clusters, managed by the management cluster, are referred to as workload clusters.

<p>
    The management cluster provides management and operations for Tanzu. It runs Cluster-API which is used to manage workload clusters and
    multi-cluster services. The workload cluster(s) are where developerâ€™s workloads run. </p>
</p>

<p>
    When you create a management cluster, a bootstrap
    cluster is created on your local machine. This is a <a  style="color:white" href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/" target="_blank"> Kind</a> based cluster, which runs via Docker. The bootstrap cluster creates a
    management cluster on your specified provider. The information for how to manage clusters in the target environment is then pivoted into
    the management cluster. At this point, the local bootstrap cluster is deleted.

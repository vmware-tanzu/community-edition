    An unmanaged cluster offers a single node, local workstation cluster suitable for a development/test environment. It requires minimal
    local resources and is fast to deploy. It provides support for running multiple clusters. The default Tanzu Community Edition package
    repository is automatically installed when you deploy an unmanaged cluster.

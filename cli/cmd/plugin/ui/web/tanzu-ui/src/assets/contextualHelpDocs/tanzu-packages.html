<p>
    Packages extend the functionality of Tanzu Community Edition. You can discover and deploy packages through the Tanzu CLI. A Tanzu
    package is an aggregation of Kubernetes configurations, and its associated software container image, into a versioned and distributable
    bundle, that can be deployed as an OCI container image. Packages are installed into a Tanzu cluster.
</p>

<p>Run tanzu package list in your terminal to view avaliable packages on an unmanaged cluster, or workload cluster.</p>

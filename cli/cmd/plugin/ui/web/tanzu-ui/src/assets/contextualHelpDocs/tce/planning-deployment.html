<p>A Tanzu Community Edition deployment consists of the following high level steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Decision time: You must decide, which of the following suits your desired outcome: <br />
        Do you want a single node, local workstation cluster suitable for a development/test environment? If so deploy an unmanaged cluster.
        Start here: Deploy Unmanaged Clusters.<br />
        or <br />
        Do you want a full-featured, scalable Kubernetes implementation suitable for a development or production environment? If so deploy a
        managed cluster. Start here: Deploy Managed Clusters.
    </li>
    <li>
        Install Tanzu CLI: Regardless of which route you choose, you will start by installing the Tanzu CLI. Installation steps are
        available in both the managed and unmanaged cluster Getting Started Guides.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deploy your chosen cluster type: Now that you have chosen your cluster deployment type and installed the Tanzu CLI, you are ready to
        deploy your cluster. Deployment steps are available in both the managed and unmanaged cluster Getting Started Guides.
    </li>
    <li>
        Deploy packages: If you want to deploy applications on any cluster you will need some packages. - For unmanaged clusters, the
        package repository is already installed, so you can start to install individual packages. Steps for a sample package installation
        are available in Create Unmanaged Clusters. - For a managed cluster deployment, you must first install the package repository, and
        then you are ready to install individual packages. Steps are available for both in Create Managed Clusters.
    </li>
</ul>

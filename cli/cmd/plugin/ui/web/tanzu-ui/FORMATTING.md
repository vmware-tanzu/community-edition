# File and Code Formatting Best Practices

## All React Typescript Files

There are several types of React classes or components that you might create when developing in the
TCE Guided UI. Whether creating a new component, store, actions, or even constants; your file should be suffixed with `.tsx`.

### Naming Your File

All filename prefixes should be pascal case (example: MyReactComponent.tsx).

Here are some general guidelines for the filenames:

- Component - should consist of component name plus suffix. (example: MyReactComponent.tsx)
- Constants - should include `constants` between name and suffix (example: App.constants.tsx)
- Stores - should include `store` between name and suffix (example: App.store.tsx)
- Actions - should include `actions` between name and suffix (example: App.actions.tsx)
- Reducers - should include `reducers` between name and suffix (example: App.reducer.tsx)

# Metrics

The TCE project automatically reports metrics
regarding cluster creation, builds, and more.

_*Note*_: At the time of this writing, metrics can only be visualized via the internal VMware WaveFront instance.
In the future, it is intended that the WaveFront dashboard used to monitor TCE performance
will be made public and viewable by the community.

Metrics are _only_ reported on GitHub Action runs and are injested directly by WaveFront.
This gives the maintainers and community reproducible data points for potential performance regressions.

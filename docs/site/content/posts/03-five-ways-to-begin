**VMware Tanzu Community Edition: Five Ways to Begin**

One of the challenges that many of us face when looking at something new
is that of figuring out just how to get started. You may be experiencing
a little bit of that right now, as begin your journey with VMware Tanzu
Community Edition. The good news is that, regardless of how familiar you
already are (or aren't) with cloud native concepts, with Kubernetes and
related technologies, or with Tanzu Community Edition specifically,
you'll likely find just what you need to take your first (or next!) step
right here in our community.

Following are five ways you can get started with Tanzu Community
Edition. Think about your current level of cloud native expertise, then
choose an entry point that's right for you!

**Step 1: Learn about cloud native**

How much background do you have with cloud native concepts and
technologies? If you are new in this arena, your first step may be to
build a foundation of basic knowledge that will help you make better
sense of Tanzu Community Edition. At
[KubeAcademy](https://kube.academy/), you'll find just what you need: a
full catalog of freely available online courses that introduce you to
Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, and to the problems you
can solve with them.

**Step 2: Learn about Tanzu Community Edition**

If you already have foundational cloud native knowledge, you may be
ready to dig into Kubernetes and learn more by doing. This is where
you'll want to take advantage of Tanzu Community Edition---it's the
perfect Kubernetes platform for hands-on learning, and for handling your
real-world applications as well. Find out more about what Tanzu
Community Edition is, what you can do with it, where to get it, and how
to get help with a quick look at any or all of these introductory
resources:

-  Read the [announcement blog](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/vmware-tanzu-community-edition-announcement) *5 mins*

-  Watch a [3-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp5qJAyDpsQ) *3 mins*

-  Check out the [FAQ](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu/community#faq) *3 mins*

-  Replay the [introductory webinar](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/webinars/nov-18-vmware-tanzu-community-edition-a-free-kubernetes-platform-for-learners-and-users) *60 mins*

**Step 3: Try using Tanzu Community Edition in a hosted sandbox**

Tanzu Community Edition is software that you, or someone in your
organization, will typically run and manage. But if you'd like to
quickly see what you can do with the platform without having to first
install it, you can try it out in a hosted sandbox environment. Two
workshops enable you to experience Tanzu Community Edition in this way:

1.  Start with the [Deploying Apps and Microservices with Tanzu Community Edition](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/workshops/lab-tce-deploy/) workshop, in which you'll use Tanzu Community Edition to deploy, scale, publish, and monitor a cloud native application). *15 mins*

2.  In a second workshop, [Manage Platform Dependencies with Tanzu Community Edition](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/workshops/lab-tce-dependencies/), you will use built-in package management tooling to customize your platform's capabilities. *15 mins*

**Step 4: Get your own cluster up and running**

When you're ready to set up a Tanzu Community Edition cluster, you'll
want to turn to these helpful resources:

-  The Tanzu Community Edition [installation instructions](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/docs/latest/installation-planning/) detail the software download and configuration process, and the steps involved in setting up a new workload cluster.

-  You can customize your cluster by adding capabilities that are useful to you. Check out the list of optional [packages](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/packages/) that you can install into your cluster.

-  Boskey Savla's blog "[Getting Started with Tanzu Community Edition](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/getting-started-vmware-tanzu-community-edition-guide)" walks you through the complete getting-started process---from software download through cluster customization---for a typical deployment.

**Step 5: Use Tanzu Community Edition**

This is where the fun really begins! You can now enjoy free and
unrestricted use of Tanzu Community Edition in any way you like, and for
as long as you like. If you get stuck along the way, know that the
community has your back. Take advantage of:

-  Many, many resources available to you in the [Tanzu Developer Center](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer), including articles, guides, samples, videos, workshops, and more---all designed to help you build and sharpen your cloud native skills and knowledge.

-  [Community Office Hours](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/community/), [Community Meetings](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/community/), and communication channels ([Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02GY94A8KT) and [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/tanzu-community-edition)) are also here to serve you. Join folks like yourself, beginners and experts alike, eager to ask and answer questions, share work, discuss ideas, and enjoy camaraderie.

**What next?**

I hope that Tanzu Community Edition opens the door to a grand new
adventure for you, as it is already doing for many of us. Go now and
explore new territory and do amazing things! And along the way, very
importantly, return to the community some of what you gain, by sharing
your success and helping others find their way in this vast new world as
well. Above all, have lots of fun!

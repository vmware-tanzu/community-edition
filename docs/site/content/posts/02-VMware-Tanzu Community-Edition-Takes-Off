**VMware Tanzu Community Edition Takes
Off!**

![](/img/rocket.jpg)

"Pleased" is a nice word, and "delighted" is too, but neither quite
captures the way we're feeling right now. "Excited" is better; "elated"
is getting close \... "ecstatic" maybe? You get the idea. The simple
truth is that we are beyond thrilled to see the tremendous response to
the release of VMware Tanzu Community Edition! In case you missed the
excitement around the introduction of this freely available Kubernetes
platform for learners and users, allow me to fill you in.

Just a few weeks ago, on October 4, [Tanzu Community
Edition](http://www.tanzucommunityedition.io) was released.
Immediate uptake has been explosive and amazing, and it continues to
expand at an incredible rate. To date we've seen hundreds of thousands
of web mentions and tens of thousands of visitors to our web site.
Downloads are off the charts, and thousands of you have already begun
exploring Tanzu Community Edition through hands-on workshops. Wow! What
a great start for our community. üòä

If you are new to the party, you can quickly catch up on Tanzu Community
Edition release news and perspectives from a few of our favorite blog
posts:

-   In VMware's [formal announcement](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/vmware-tanzu-community-edition-announcement) of Tanzu Community Edition, Amanda Katona breaks the news about the release. Take a quick read to catch up on what Tanzu Community Edition is, who it is for, and how it can be used.

-   Nigel Brown and Roger Klorese [welcome all to collaborate and contribute](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/posts/community-is-our-middle-name-welcome/) together in the community's inaugural blog.

-   Always insightful, [Craig McLuckie's blog post](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/blog/vmware-tanzu-community-edition-kubernetes-cloud-native-ecosystem) discusses the importance of open source technologies in the cloud
native landscape and the value of being able to easily consume them with Tanzu Community Edition.

-   Especially if you're a developer, you'll want to check out [Grant
 Shipley's suggestions](https://tanzu.vmware.com/developer/blog/expanding-the-developer-toolbox-with-vmware-tanzu-community-edition/) for a few open source tools that you'll want to use with Tanzu Community Edition.

Clearly, there is a real need for an offering like Tanzu Community
Edition. That's surely no surprise: what application developer,
infrastructure operator, site-reliability engineer, or DevOps engineer
wouldn't want to learn or use Kubernetes today with a freely available,
open source Kubernetes platform? One that can be installed and
configured in minutes on a local workstation or favorite cloud, and
that's backed by one of the world's most trusted enterprise technology
providers? It all adds up to incredible opportunity for you: now is the
right time to build your cloud native expertise, and this is just the
tool to help you do that.

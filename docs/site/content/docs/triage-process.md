# Triage Process

## Issues

Issues are regularly triaged (weekly), the triage process is described in this
[github issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/issues/1829).

## Office Hours

We encourage attending Office Hours meetings for in person discussions. Twice a month, Tanzu Community Edition maintainers are available at Office Hour meetings as described in the Meet with Us section [here](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/community/#). This is an open forum where community members can discuss issues in person with maintainers.

## Tracking issues

As a project with many components, some issues may require opening ancillary issues in other open source projects. In these cases, the original issue will remain open and serve as a tracking issue upon resolution of issues in other projects.

# Run Conformance Tests

Tanzu Community Edition has an integrated Sonobuoy plugin. The Tanzu CLI uses the conformance command (powered by Sonobuoy) to run tests against clusters.  Use the ``tanzu conformance`` command to run diagnostic tests to help you to  understand the state of a  cluster.   The ``tanzu conformance`` runs the [CNCF conformance tests](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance#certified-kubernetes) by default. For more information, see [Sonobuoy](https://sonobuoy.io/).

## Before you Begin

Ensure the Tanzu CLI is installed.

## Procedure

1. To see a list of the conformance commands, run:

    ```sh
    tanzu conformance
    ```

    The following commands are available:
    |Command           |Description|
    |:------------------------ |:--- |
    |delete| Deletes Kubernetes resources that were generated by a Sonobuoy run. |
    |gen | Generates a Sonobuoy manifest for submission via the kubectl. |
    |logs | Dumps the logs of the currently running Sonobuoy containers for diagnostics. |
    |results |Inspect plugin results. |
    |retrieve| Retrieves the results of a Sonobuoy run to a specified path. |
    |run | Starts a Sonobouy run by launching the Sonobuoy aggregator and plugin pods. |
    |status|Gets a summarized status of a Sonobuoy run.|
    |version|Prints Sonobouy and Tanzu build information.|

1. To start a conformance test running in the cluster, run:

    ```sh
    tanzu conformance run
    ```

1. To view the status of the test, run

    ```sh
    tanzu conformance status
    ```

1. To verify that the conformance test is starting correctly, run:

    ```

    > You should see Sonobuoy containers starting or running.

[imgpkg](https://carvel.dev/imgpkg/) is a Carvel tool that enables you to package, distribute, and relocate your Kubernetes configuration and OCI images as a bundle. Imgpkg performs operations similar to the docker and crane commands, allowing you to create, push, pull, and operate on OCI images and bundles. A sha256 digest is created for the bundle based on its contents, allowing imgpkg to verify the bundle's integrity. Bundles are important because they capture your configuration and image references as one discrete unit. As a unit, your configuration and images can be referenced and copied. Referencing your configuration and images as a unit allows for easy operation with air-gaped environments.

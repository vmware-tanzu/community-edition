    ```sh
    brew install vmware-tanzu/tanzu/tanzu-community-edition

    ```

## Option 2: Use the binary download/install  method

    ```sh
    cd <DOWNLOAD-DIR>
    tar xzvf tce-darwin-amd64-{{< release_latest >}}.tar.gz

    ```

1. Change to the extracted directory and run the install script.

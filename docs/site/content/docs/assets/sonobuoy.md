## Run Tanzu conformance command

Tanzu Community Edition has an integrated Sonobuoy plugin. The Tanzu CLI uses the conformance command (powered by Sonobuoy) to run tests against clusters.  Use the ``tanzu conformance`` command to run diagnostic tests to help you to  understand the state of a  cluster.   The ``tanzu conformance`` runs the [CNCF conformance tests](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance#certified-kubernetes) by default. For more information, see [Sonobuoy](https://sonobuoy.io/).

### Before you Begin
Ensure the Tanzu CLI is installed.

### Procedure

1. To see a list of the conformance commands, run:
 
    ```sh

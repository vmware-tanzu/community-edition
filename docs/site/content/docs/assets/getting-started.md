# Getting Started with TCE

This guide walks you through standing up a management and guest cluster using
Tanzu CLI. It then demonstrates how you can deploy add-ons into the cluster.
Currently we have getting started guides for [vSphere](#create-vsphere-clusters),
[AWS](#create-aws-clusters), and [Docker](#create-local-docker-clusters-capd). For detailed documentation on tanzu-cli and deployment of clusters,
see the [TKG docs](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid/index.html).

[Vendir](https://carvel.dev/vendir/) is a Carvel tool used in the package creation process. Use vendir to synchronize the contents of remote data sources into a consistent local directory. Use a YAML file to define the remote data location and how you want to structure that data locally. Vendir will copy the data locally so that you can operate on it. For example, you can indicate in a YAML file that you want to retrieve the manifest for cert-manager v1.5.3 in GitHub, and put it in a local `/config/upstream` directory.

Unmanaged clusters offer Tanzu environments for **development** and
**experimentation**. By default, they run locally via [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) with Tanzu components installed atop. If you're interested in running cluster(s) in a production-ready context, see
our guidance around [managed-clusters](/getting-started).

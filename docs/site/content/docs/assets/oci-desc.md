During package, and package repository creation, you will upload your package and package repository to an OCI Registry.  You can use any public OCI compliant registry, for example:
  * Docker Hub (Note: You can quickly run into rate limiting issues.)
  * GitHub Container Registry
  * Google Container Registry
  * Harbor
  * ttl.sh

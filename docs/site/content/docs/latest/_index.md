## Overview

VMware Tanzu Community Edition is a full-featured, easy to manage Kubernetes platform
for learners and users. It is a freely available, community supported, open source
distribution of VMware Tanzu that can be installed and configured in minutes on your
local workstation or your favorite cloud.

Tanzu Community Edition enables the creation of application platforms.

Tanzu Community Edition does this by leveraging [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to
provide declarative deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes
acts as the foundation in which we orchestrate workloads. With this foundation
in place, Tanzu Community Edition enables the installation of platform packages that support
applications running in clusters.

Tanzu Community Edition allows you to get bootstrapped by providing a set of opinionated building blocks.
Additionally, it enables you to add or replace these with your own components. This
flexibility enables you to produce application platforms that meet your unique
requirements without having to start from scratch.

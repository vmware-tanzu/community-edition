VMware Tanzu Community Edition is a full-featured, easy to manage Kubernetes
platform for learners and users. It is a freely available, community supported,
open source distribution of VMware Tanzu that can be installed and configured
in minutes on your local workstation or your favorite cloud.

The project enables the creation of application platforms. It
does this by leveraging [Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) to
provide declarative deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes
acts as the foundation in which we orchestrate workloads. With this foundation
in place, Tanzu Community Edition enables the installation of platform packages that support
applications running in clusters.

Tanzu Community Edition allows you to get bootstrapped by providing a set of opinionated building blocks.
Additionally, it enables you to add or replace these with your own components. This
flexibility enables you to produce application platforms that meet your unique
requirements without having to start from scratch.

With Tanzu Community Edition, it is easy for experienced and aspiring cloud native practitioners to independently learn about, evaluate, and/or use Kubernetes and other cloud native technologies, in community-supported environments.

## Who should use Tanzu Community Edition

- Aspiring and experienced **cloud native practitioners** (including **operators**, **DevOps**, and **developers**) looking to build new cloud native skills
- Skilled **cloud native practitioners** looking for a free Kubernetes-based application platform to use in their self-supported environment
- **Platform and IT infrastructure operators** as well as **Site Reliabilty Engineers** looking to provide and manage container infrastructure for their internal users or customers in self-supported environments
- **Cloud native ecosystem participants**, for example, **independent software vendors** looking to build their businesses around platform-adjacent opportunities

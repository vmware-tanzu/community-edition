# Delete Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters

To delete a workload cluster, run the `tanzu cluster delete` command.

1. To list all of the workload clusters that a management cluster is managing, run the `tanzu cluster list` command.

   ```sh
   tanzu cluster list
   ```  

2. (Optional) Depending on the cluster contents and cloud infrastructure, you may need to delete in-cluster volumes and services before you delete the workload cluster. For more information, see the following sections below:<br>[Delete in-cluster volumes and services](delete-cluster/#delete-in-cluster-volumes-and-services)<br> [Delete Service Type LoadBalancer](delete-cluster/#delete-service-type-loadbalancer)<br> [Delete Persistent Volume Claims and Persistent Volumes](delete-cluster/#delete-persistent-volume-pv-and-persistent-volume-claim-pvc-objects-in-a-cluster)

3. To delete a workload cluster, run:

   ```sh
   tanzu cluster delete <WORKLOAD-CLUSTER>
   ```

   If the cluster is running in a namespace other than the `default` namespace, you must specify the `--namespace` option to delete that cluster.

   ```sh
   tanzu cluster delete my-cluster --namespace=my-namespace
   ```
## Delete in-cluster volumes and services

If the cluster you want to delete contains persistent volumes or services such as load balancers and databases, you may need to manually delete them before you delete the cluster itself.
What you need to pre-delete depends on your cloud infrastructure:

* **vSphere**

    * **Load Balancer**: see [Delete Service type LoadBalancer](delete-cluster/#delete-service-type-loadbalancer) below.
    * **Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims**: see [Delete Persistent Volume Claims and Persistent Volumes](delete-cluster/#delete-persistent-volume-pv-and-persistent-volume-claim-pvc-objects-in-a-cluster), below.

* **Amazon EC2**

    * **Load Balancers**: Application or Network Load Balancers (ALBs or NLBs) in the cluster's VPC, but not Classic Load Balancers (ELB v1).
    * **Other Services**: Any subnet/EC2 backed service in cluster's VPC, such as an RDS.
    * **Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims**: see [Delete Persistent Volume Claims and Persistent Volumes](delete-cluster/#delete-persistent-volume-pv-and-persistent-volume-claim-pvc-objects-in-a-cluster), below.

* **Azure**

    * No action required.
    Deleting a workload cluster deletes everything that was created in the cluster's resource group.

## Delete Service Type LoadBalancer

To delete Service type LoadBalancer (Service) in a cluster:

1. Set `kubectl` to the cluster's context.

   ```sh
   kubectl config set-context my-cluster@user
   ```

1. Retrieve the cluster's list of services.

   ```sh
   kubectl get service
   ```

1. Delete each Service type `LoadBalancer`.

    ```sh
    kubectl delete service <my-svc>
    ```

### Delete Persistent Volume (PV) and Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) objects in a cluster:

1. Run `kubectl config set-context my-cluster@user` to set `kubectl` to the cluster's context.

2. Run `kubectl get pvc` to retrieve the cluster's Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

3. For each PVC:


   1. To identify the PV it is bound to, run the following command, the PV is listed in the command output as **Volume**, after **Status: Bound**:

    ```sh
    kubectl describe pvc <my-pvc>
    ```

   2. To determine if its bound PV `Reclaim Policy` is `Retain` or `Delete`, run.

    ```sh
    kubectl describe pv <my-pv>
    ```

   3. To delete the PVC, run:

    ```sh
    kubectl delete pvc <my-pvc>
    ```

   4. If the PV reclaim policy is `Retain`, run the following command and then log into your cloud portal and delete the PV object there:
    ```sh
    kubectl delete pv <my-pvc>
    ```

**IMPORTANT**: Do not change context or edit the `.kube-tkg/config` file while Tanzu operations are running.

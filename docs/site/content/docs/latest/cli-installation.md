# CLI Installation
To use Tanzu Community Edition, you must download and run the Tanzu CLI on a local system, commonly referred to as the bootstrap environment. The bootstrap environment is the laptop, host, or server on which the initial bootstrapping of a management cluster or standalone cluster is performed. This is where you run Tanzu  CLI commands.

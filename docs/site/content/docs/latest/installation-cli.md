# Installing the Tanzu CLI

To use Tanzu Community Edition, you must download and run the Tanzu CLI on a local system, commonly referred to as the bootstrap environment. The bootstrap environment is the laptop, host, or server on which the initial bootstrapping of a management cluster or standalone cluster is performed. This is where you run Tanzu  CLI commands.

## Prerequisites

Install Tanzu CLI on:
- Linux or Mac OS
- Windows is not directly supported right now, if you are  bootstrapping from a Windows desktop, you must run Linux from your Windows machine using one of the following methods:
        - Create a Linux VM, for example, use VMware Workstation Pro
        - Install Windows Subsystem for Linux, for more information, see [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
- 6 GB of RAM and a 2-core CPU

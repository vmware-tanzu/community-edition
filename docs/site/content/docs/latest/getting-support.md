# Getting Support

## Knowledge Base

VMware maintains a publicly searchable knowledge base for product support and can be accessed without registration. The Tanzu Community Edition cluster management capability closely aligns to the corresponding capability in VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid and [this search](https://kb.vmware.com/s/global-search/%40uri#t=MoreContent&sort=relevancy&f:@commonsource=[Lightning%20KB]&f:@commonproduct=[Tanzu%20Kubernetes%20Grid]) in VMware Customer Connect  can yield relevant results.

## Open Support Request

Tanzu Community Edition is supported through community and on a best-effort basis by maintainers. Tanzu customers with an active subscription can file support requests for products at [VMware Customer Connect Portal](https://my.vmware.com).

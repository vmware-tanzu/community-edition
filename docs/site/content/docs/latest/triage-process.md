# Triage Process

## Office Hours

Issues filed are regularly (weekly) triaged and we encourage attending office hours for in person discussions. Twice a month, Tanzu Community Edition maintainers are available at Office Hour meetings as described in the Meet with Us section [here](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/community/#). This is an open forum where community members can discuss issues in person with maintainers.

## Tracking issues

As a project with many components, some issues may require opening ancillary issues in other open source projects. In these cases, the original issue will remain open and serve as a tracking issue upon resolution of issues in other projects.

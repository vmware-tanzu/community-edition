1. **Install Tanzu Community Edition.**

   You will download this from GitHub and install it on your desktop machine. This installs the Tanzu CLI. For information about the supported operating systems and prerequisites for your desktop machine, see the[Support Matrix](support-matrix/#local-client-bootstrap-machine-prerequisites). For information about the Tanzu Community Edition architecture, see [Architecture](architecture).

1. **Prepare to deploy clusters.**
   Choose the target platform where you want to deploy clusters and ensure that the prerequisites are met for this platform. See Target Platforms below.

1. **Deploy a cluster to your target platform.**

   Use the Tanzu CLI to launch the Tanzu Community Edition installer, deploy a [management cluster](glossary/#management-cluster), and then deploy a [workload cluster](glossary/#workload-cluster).

   **Note**: the installer is a web based interface, if you need to perform an installation on a machine that does not have a desktop environment, see [Headless Installation](headless-install).

1. **Install and configure packages.**

   Use the Tanzu CLI to install and configure [Packages](glossary/#package).

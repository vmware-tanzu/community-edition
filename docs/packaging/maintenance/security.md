# Security

At this time, the Tanzu Community Edition project has no commitment for
time-to-resolution for CVE or other security-related issues. This is largely due
to the fact that resolving CVEs in a package require coordination with an
upstream project. For projects not governed by VMware, we do not provide direct
patching to the software underlying a package outside of a potential
contribution to the upstream project.

However, we do take security-related issues very seriously. Our [security
release
process](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
describes how we approach security-related issues. If a security-issue is opened
that relates to your package, we expect maintainers to help us find a path to
resolution in the fastest time possible.

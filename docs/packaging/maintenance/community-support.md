# Community Support

Packages in Tanzu Community Edition are supported as best-effort by package
maintainers. Support is provided via GitHub issues and Slack.

## GitHub

When an issue relating to a package in TCE is opened, the following occurs:

1. The issue is marked as `area/package` indicating the work is owned by the
   package maintainer(s).
1. Package maintainer(s) are cc'd in the ticket for visibility.
1. If the package lives in an external repository, the TCE team opens an issue
   in that repository.

## Slack

Users of Tanzu Community Edition often ask questions in the
[#tanzu-community-edition](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C02GY94A8KT)
(Kubernetes) Slack channel. When questions come in pertaining to a package, the
TCE team may `@` maintainers for assistance. We ask that maintainers have an
account in the Kubernetes Slack.

# Proposal

Before starting work on a new package you intend to include in the TCE
distribution, please open an issue describing what you'd like to include. Our
[proposal process is detailed
here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/tree/main/docs/designs).
Often a detailed issue suffices.

For external community-members, please note that at this time we are **not**
accepting external (outside of VMware) contributions to the official package
repository.

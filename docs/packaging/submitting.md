# Submitting

After creating the package, you can easily request its inclusion in TCE by
opening a pull request.

## Proposal

Before opening a pull request, you should already have a
[proposal](considerations/proposal.md) open. You will open this PR against this
proposal such that merging the PR will close/resolve the proposal.

## Pull Request

When your package is complete and ready for acceptance, create a Pull Request in the [community-edition](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/community-edition/pulls) GitHub repository. The PR should reference the GitHub issue created for introducing the package. The PR will be reviewed by the Tanzu Community Edition Engineering Team. Upon approval, the package will be added to the main package repository.

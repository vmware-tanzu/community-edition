# Tanzu Community Edition

Tanzu Community Edition is a fully-featured, easy to manage, Kubernetes platform
for learners and users. It is a freely available, community supported, and open
source distribution of VMware Tanzu. It can be installed and deployed in minutes to your
local workstation or favorite infrastructure provider. Along with cluster
management, powered by [Cluster API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api),
Tanzu Community Edition enables higher-level functionality via its robust
[package management](https://tanzucommunityedition.io/docs/latest/package-management)
built on top of [Carvel's kapp-controller](https://carvel.dev/kapp-controller/),
and opinionated, yet extensible, [Carvel packages](#packages).

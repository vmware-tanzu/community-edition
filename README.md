# Tanzu Community Edition

Acting on insights gained through community engagement over the past year, VMware has decided to offer a free download of VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in place of VMware Tanzu Community Edition software and to retire the Tanzu Community Edition open source project.

This project is no longer being updated or maintained and code related to the project will be removed by the end of this calendar year (Dec 2022). Users can download Tanzu Kubernetes Grid [here](https://www.vmware.com/go/get-tkg).

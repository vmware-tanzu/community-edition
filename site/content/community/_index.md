## Do you want to help build Velero?

If you’re a newcomer, check out the “[Good first issue](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+first+issue%22)” and “[Help wanted](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Help+wanted%22+)” labels in the Velero repository.

Read how [we're using ZenHub](https://velero.io/docs/main/zenhub) for project and roadmap planning.

If you are ready to jump in and test, add code, or help with documentation, follow the instructions on our [Start contributing](https://velero.io/docs/main/start-contributing/) documentation for guidance on how to setup Velero for development.

You can follow the work we do, see our milestones, and our backlog on our [ZenHub board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/vmware-tanzu/velero/boards?filterLogic=all&repos=99143276).

                      the TLS serving certificate for the HTTPS endpoints served by
                      this FederationDomain. When provided, the TLS Secret named here
                      must contain keys named `tls.crt` and `tls.key` that contain
                      the certificate and private key to use for TLS. \n Server Name

                      if you would like to use different TLS certificates for issuers
                      of different hostnames. SNI requests do not include port numbers,
                      so all issuers with the same DNS hostname must use the same
                      SecretName value even if they have different port numbers. \n
                      SecretName is not required when you would like to use only the
                      HTTP endpoints (e.g. when the HTTP listener is configured to
                      listen on loopback interfaces or UNIX domain sockets for traffic
                      from a service mesh sidecar). It is also not required when you
                      would like all requests to this OIDC Provider's HTTPS endpoints
                      to use the default TLS certificate, which is configured elsewhere.

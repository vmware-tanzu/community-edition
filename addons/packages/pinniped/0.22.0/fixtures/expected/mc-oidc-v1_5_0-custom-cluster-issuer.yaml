When not specified, the default will act as if the filter were specified as "(&(objectClass=group)(member:1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941:={})". This searches nested groups by default. Note that nested group search can be slow for some Active Directory servers. To disable it, you can set the filter to "(&(objectClass=group)(member={})"

This allows group membership changes to be quickly reflected into Kubernetes clusters.  Since group membership is often used to bind authorization policies, it is important to keep the groups observed in Kubernetes clusters in-sync with the identity provider. \n In some environments, frequent group membership queries may result in a significant performance impact on the identity provider and/or the supervisor. The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak the group query to be more performant, for example by disabling nested group search or by using a more targeted group search base. \n If the group search query cannot be made performant and you are willing to have group memberships remain static for approximately a day, then set skipGroupRefresh to true.  This is an insecure configuration as authorization policies that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user has been removed from a particular group until their next login. \n This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly altered in the future.  Consumers of this configuration should carefully read all release notes before upgrading to ensure that the meaning of this field has not changed."

When not specified, the default will be '(&(objectClass=person)(!(objectClass=computer))(!(showInAdvancedViewOnly=TRUE))(|(sAMAccountName={}")(mail={})(userPrincipalName={})(sAMAccountType=805306368))' This means that the user is a person, is not a computer, the sAMAccountType is for a normal user account, and is not shown in advanced view only (which would likely mean its a system created service account with advanced permissions). Also, either the sAMAccountName, the userPrincipalName, or the mail attribute matches the input username.

Since group membership is often used to bind authorization policies, it is important to keep the groups observed in Kubernetes clusters in-sync with the identity provider. \n In some environments, frequent group membership queries may result in a significant performance impact on the identity provider and/or the supervisor. The best approach to handle performance impacts is to tweak the group query to be more performant, for example by disabling nested group search or by using a more targeted group search base. \n If the group search query cannot be made performant and you are willing to have group memberships remain static for approximately a day, then set skipGroupRefresh to true.  This is an insecure configuration as authorization policies that are bound to group membership will not notice if a user has been removed from a particular group until their next login. \n This is an experimental feature that may be removed or significantly altered in the future.  Consumers of this configuration should carefully read all release notes before upgrading to ensure that the meaning of this field has not changed."

The standard parameters that will be sent are "response_type", "scope", "client_id", "state", "nonce", "code_challenge", "code_challenge_method", and "redirect_uri". These parameters cannot be included in this setting. Additionally, the "hd" parameter cannot be included in this setting at this time. The "hd" parameter is used by Google's OIDC provider to provide a hint as to which "hosted domain" the user should use during login. However, Pinniped does not yet support validating the hosted domain in the resulting ID token, so it is not yet safe to use this feature of Google's OIDC provider with Pinniped. This setting does not influence the parameters sent to the token endpoint in the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant. The Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the Supervisor from the authorization flows. Some OIDC providers may require a certain value for the "prompt" parameter in order to properly request refresh tokens. See the documentation of your OIDC provider's authorization endpoint for its requirements for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh token in the response, if anything. If your provider requires the prompt parameter to request a refresh token, then include it here. Also note that most providers also require a certain scope to be requested in order to receive refresh tokens. See the additionalScopes setting for more information about using scopes to request refresh tokens.

See https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#OfflineAccess for a description of the "offline_access" scope. This default value may change in future versions of Pinniped as the standard evolves, or as common patterns used by providers who implement the standard in the ecosystem evolve. By setting this list to anything other than an empty list, you are overriding the default value, so you may wish to include some of "offline_access", "email", and "profile" in your override list. If you do not want any of these scopes to be requested, you may set this list to contain only "openid". Some OIDC providers may also require a scope to get access to the user''s group membership, in which case you may wish to include it in this list. Sometimes the scope to request the user''s group membership is called "groups", but unfortunately this is not specified in the OIDC standard. Generally speaking, you should include any scopes required to cause the appropriate claims to be the returned by your OIDC provider in the ID token or userinfo endpoint results for those claims which you would like to use in the oidcClaims settings to determine the usernames and group memberships of your Kubernetes users. See your OIDC provider''s documentation for more information about what scopes are available to request claims. Additionally, the Pinniped Supervisor requires that your OIDC provider returns refresh tokens to the Supervisor from these authorization flows. For most OIDC providers, the scope required to receive refresh tokens will be "offline_access". See the documentation of your OIDC provider''s authorization and token endpoints for its requirements for what to include in the request in order to receive a refresh token in the response, if anything. Note that it may be safe to send "offline_access" even to providers which do not require it, since the provider may ignore scopes that it does not understand or require (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.3). In the unusual case that you must avoid sending the "offline_access" scope, then you must override the default value of this setting. This is required if your OIDC provider will reject the request when it includes "offline_access" (e.g. GitLab''s OIDC provider).'

                  allowPasswordGrant:
                    description: allowPasswordGrant, when true, will allow the use of OAuth 2.0's Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (see https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) to authenticate to the OIDC provider using a username and password without a web browser, in addition to the usual browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow. The Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant is not officially part of the OIDC specification, so it may not be supported by your OIDC provider. If your OIDC provider supports returning ID tokens from a Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant token request, then you can choose to set this field to true. This will allow end users to choose to present their username and password to the kubectl CLI (using the Pinniped plugin) to authenticate to the cluster, without using a web browser to log in as is customary in OIDC Authorization Code Flow. This may be convenient for users, especially for identities from your OIDC provider which are not intended to represent a human actor, such as service accounts performing actions in a CI/CD environment. Even if your OIDC provider supports it, you may wish to disable this behavior by setting this field to false when you prefer to only allow users of this OIDCIdentityProvider to log in via the browser-based OIDC Authorization Code Flow. Using the Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant means that the Pinniped CLI and Pinniped Supervisor will directly handle your end users' passwords (similar to LDAPIdentityProvider), and you will not be able to require multi-factor authentication or use the other web-based login features of your OIDC provider during Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant logins. allowPasswordGrant defaults to false.

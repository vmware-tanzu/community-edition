#@ load("@ytt:overlay", "overlay")

#! We are adding this in the 0.12.0 package to workaround a breaking change that
#! is encountered when upgrading from the 0.4.4 package.
#!
#! The breaking change was introduced in the Pinniped 0.6.0 release - Pinniped
#! Concierge CRDs were changed from namespace scoped to cluster scoped. The
#! scope of CRDs cannot be updated in place, so we will tell kapp to replace
#! (delete and create) the CRDs.
